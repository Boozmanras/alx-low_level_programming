## Description

This project involves implementing various search algorithms in C. The goal is to understand how different search algorithms work and their time and space complexities. You will implement linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search, exponential search, and advanced binary search.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a search algorithm is.
- Implement and differentiate between linear search and binary search.
- Choose the best search algorithm depending on the needs.
- Understand the time and space complexities of these algorithms.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Compiler**: `gcc` with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Coding Style**: Betty style
- **Prototypes**: All function prototypes should be included in a header file called `search_algos.h`

## Files

- `0-linear.c`: Linear search algorithm.
- `1-binary.c`: Binary search algorithm.
- `2-jump.c`: Jump search algorithm.
- `3-interpolation.c`: Interpolation search algorithm.
- `4-exponential.c`: Exponential search algorithm.
- `100-advanced_binary.c`: Advanced binary search algorithm.
- `search_algos.h`: Header file containing prototypes for all functions.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Tasks

### Mandatory

1. **Linear search**
    - Implement a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.

2. **Binary search**
    - Implement a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.

3. **Jump search**
    - Implement a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Jump search algorithm.

4. **Interpolation search**
    - Implement a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Interpolation search algorithm.

5. **Exponential search**
    - Implement a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Exponential search algorithm.

### Advanced

6. **Advanced binary search**
    - Implement a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using an advanced version of the Binary search algorithm.
