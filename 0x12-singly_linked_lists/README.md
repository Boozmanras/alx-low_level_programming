<h2>Learning Objectives:</h2>
<p>By the end of the project, participants are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When and why to use linked lists instead of arrays.</li>
  <li>How to build and use linked lists.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Project Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The project requires using the Betty style, which is a set of coding style guidelines.</li>
  <li>The code should be written using allowed editors (vi, vim, emacs) and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using specific compiler options.</li>
  <li>All files should end with a new line.</li>
  <li>A README.md file is mandatory.</li>
  <li>Global variables are not allowed.</li>
  <li>The only standard C library functions allowed are malloc, free, and exit.</li>
  <li>The project involves several tasks, each with specific requirements. The tasks involve creating functions that perform various operations on linked lists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks Overview:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Print List:</strong> Implement a function that prints all elements of a list_t linked list. The function should return the number of nodes.</li>
  <li><strong>List Length:</strong> Create a function that returns the number of elements in a list_t linked list.</li>
  <li><strong>Add Node:</strong> Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t linked list.</li>
  <li><strong>Add Node at the End:</strong> Implement a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t linked list.</li>
  <li><strong>Free List:</strong> Create a function that frees a list_t linked list.</li>
  <li><strong>The Hare and the Tortoise:</strong> Write a function that prints a specific message before the main function is executed.</li>
  <li><strong>Real Programmers Can Write Assembly Code in Any Language:</strong> Write a 64-bit assembly program that prints a specific message.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each task comes with its own set of requirements and example code for testing.</p>
