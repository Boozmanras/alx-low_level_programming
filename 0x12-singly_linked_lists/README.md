 - Singly Linked Lists

## Description

This project focuses on the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists in C. The tasks involve writing functions that operate on linked list data structures, handling common operations like traversing, adding, and freeing nodes.

## Requirements

- **Compilation:** `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Code Style:** Betty style guide
- **Allowed Functions:** `malloc`, `free`, `exit`
- **Header File:** `lists.h`

## Tasks

### 0. Print list
Write a function that prints all elements of a `list_t` list. If the string is `NULL`, print `[0] (nil)`.

### 1. List length
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a `list_t` list.

### 2. Add node
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.

### 3. Add node at the end
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.

### 4. Free list
Write a function that frees a `list_t` list.

### 5. The Hare and the Tortoise
Write a function that prints a sentence before the main function is executed, using the `constructor` attribute.

### 6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language
Write a function that prints a sentence before the main function is executed, in the assembly code language.
