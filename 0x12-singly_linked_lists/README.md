<h2> 0x12. C - Singly linked lists </h2>

Learning Objectives:
By the end of the project, participants are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

When and why to use linked lists instead of arrays.
How to build and use linked lists.
Project Requirements:

The project requires using the Betty style, which is a set of coding style guidelines.
The code should be written using allowed editors (vi, vim, emacs) and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using specific compiler options.
All files should end with a new line.
A README.md file is mandatory.
Global variables are not allowed.
The only standard C library functions allowed are malloc, free, and exit.
The project involves several tasks, each with specific requirements. The tasks involve creating functions that perform various operations on linked lists.
Tasks Overview:

Print List: Implement a function that prints all elements of a list_t linked list. The function should return the number of nodes.

List Length: Create a function that returns the number of elements in a list_t linked list.

Add Node: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t linked list.

Add Node at the End: Implement a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t linked list.

Free List: Create a function that frees a list_t linked list.

The Hare and the Tortoise: Write a function that prints a specific message before the main function is executed.

Real Programmers Can Write Assembly Code in Any Language: Write a 64-bit assembly program that prints a specific message.

Each task comes with its own set of requirements and example code for testing.
