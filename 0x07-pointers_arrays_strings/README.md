# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

This project is part of the ALX Low Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on advanced concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.

## Project Description

This project contains several C functions that demonstrate the use of pointers, multi-dimensional arrays, and string manipulation. Each task is designed to deepen understanding of memory allocation and pointer arithmetic in C.

## Files

* `0-memset.c`: Function that fills memory with a constant byte
* `1-memcpy.c`: Function that copies memory area
* `2-strchr.c`: Function that locates a character in a string
* `3-strspn.c`: Function that gets the length of a prefix substring
* `4-strpbrk.c`: Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes
* `5-strstr.c`: Function that locates a substring
* `7-print_chessboard.c`: Function that prints the chessboard
* `8-print_diagsums.c`: Function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
* `100-set_string.c`: Function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
* `101-crackme_password`: File that contains the password for the crackme2 executable

## Compilation

All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Usage

To use these functions, include them in your C project and call them as needed. Example main.c files are provided for each function to demonstrate their usage.
